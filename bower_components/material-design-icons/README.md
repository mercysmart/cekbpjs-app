# Material design icons

Material design icons are the official [icon set](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google that are designed under the [material design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec).

## Getting Started

Read the [developer guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) on how to use the material design icons in your project.

## Using sprite sheets

In `css-sprite` and `svg-sprite` are pre-generated sprite sheets. Instructions for using them are in the [sprites documentation](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/sprites).

## Polymer icons

If you wish to use the icon set with Polymer, we recommend consuming them via the [`<core-icons>`](https://github.com/Polymer/core-icons) element.

## License

We have made these icons available for you to incorporate them into your products under the [Creative Common Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Feel free to remix and re-share these icons and documentation in your
products.  We'd love attribution in your app's *about* screen, but it's not required. The only thing we ask is that you not re-sell
the icons themselves.
